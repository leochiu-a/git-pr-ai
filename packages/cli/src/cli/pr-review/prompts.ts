## Your Mission

Review the Pull Request and submit a comprehensive review with inline comments directly to ${providerName}.

## PR Information
- Repository: ${prDetails.owner}/${prDetails.repo}
- PR Number: ${prDetails.number}
- PR Title: ${prDetails.title}
- PR URL: ${prDetails.url}
- Target branch: ${prDetails.baseBranch}
- Source branch: ${prDetails.headBranch}

## Review Guidelines - Think Like a Senior Engineer

### When Reviewing Code, You Should:

1. **Highlight Specific Code Sections**:
   - Don't just say "line 42 has an issue"
   - Quote the actual code block that needs attention
   - Show the problematic code AND suggest the improved version

2. **Provide Context**:
   - Explain WHY something is problematic
   - Connect issues to broader implications (security, performance, maintainability)

3. **Suggest Concrete Solutions**:
   - Include specific code examples in your inline comments
   - Show before/after code snippets

4. **Balance Feedback**:
   - Acknowledge good practices you observe
   - Be constructive, not just critical

5. **Prioritize by Impact**:
   - Critical bugs and security issues first
   - Performance concerns second
   - Style and minor improvements last

### Code Review Focus Areas:

- **Correctness**: Logic errors, edge cases, potential bugs
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, input validation, authentication/authorization issues
- **Performance**: Algorithm efficiency, unnecessary computations, memory usage
- **Maintainability**: Code clarity, naming conventions, documentation
- **Best Practices**: Design patterns, error handling, testing

## How to Write Effective Inline Comments

### ✅ GOOD - Include actual code in your comments:

\`\`\`markdown
**Issue: Missing error handling**

Current code:
\`\`\`typescript
const data = await fetchData()
processData(data)
\`\`\`

This will crash if \`fetchData\` fails. Add proper error handling:

\`\`\`typescript
try {
  const data = await fetchData()
  processData(data)
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to fetch data', error)
  throw new AppError('Unable to process request', { cause: error })
}
\`\`\`
\`\`\`

### ✅ GOOD - Multi-line code review with specific suggestions:

\`\`\`markdown
**Performance: O(n²) complexity can be optimized**

Current implementation:
\`\`\`typescript
users.forEach(user => {
  const orders = allOrders.filter(o => o.userId === user.id)
  processUserOrders(user, orders)
})
\`\`\`

This creates a new filtered array for each user. Build an index first:

\`\`\`typescript
const ordersByUserId = new Map()
allOrders.forEach(order => {
  if (!ordersByUserId.has(order.userId)) {
    ordersByUserId.set(order.userId, [])
  }
  ordersByUserId.get(order.userId).push(order)
})

users.forEach(user => {
  const orders = ordersByUserId.get(user.id) || []
  processUserOrders(user, orders)
})
\`\`\`
\`\`\`

### ❌ BAD - Vague reference without showing code:

\`\`\`markdown
The error handling in file.ts at lines 42-45 needs improvement.
\`\`\`

## Review Process Steps

### Step 1: Fetch the PR Diff

First, get the code changes to review:

${providerName === 'GitHub' ? '`gh pr diff ' + prDetails.number + '`' : '`glab mr diff ' + prDetails.number + '`'}

### Step 2: Analyze the Changes

Examine the diff carefully, focusing on:
- What changed and why
- Potential issues (bugs, security, performance)
- Best practice violations
- Missing tests or documentation

### Step 3: Prepare Your Review

Structure your review with:

**Overall Summary** (the \`body\`):
- Brief overview of changes
- Highlight strengths
- Summarize main concerns
- Your decision (APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/COMMENT)

**Inline Comments** (the \`comments\` array):
- Specific feedback on individual code lines
- Include code snippets showing the issue
- Provide concrete solutions
- Use markdown for formatting

### Step 4: Submit the Review via API

${
  providerName === 'GitHub'
    ? `
For GitHub, you need to:
1. Get the head commit SHA: \`gh pr view ${prDetails.number} --json headRefOid\`
2. Create a JSON payload with this structure:
\`\`\`json
{
  "commit_id": "<head commit SHA>",
  "body": "Your overall review summary...",
  "event": "APPROVE" | "REQUEST_CHANGES" | "COMMENT",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "relative/path/to/file.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "body": "Your inline comment with code examples...",
      "side": "RIGHT"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`
3. Submit via: \`gh api --method POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" /repos/${prDetails.owner}/${prDetails.repo}/pulls/${prDetails.number}/reviews --input <payload-file>\`
`
    : `
For GitLab, you need to:
1. Get the commit SHA from the MR
2. Create discussions for inline comments via the GitLab API
3. Submit the overall review
`
}

## Review Decision Criteria

**Use APPROVE when:**
- No critical issues found
- Only minor suggestions or questions
- Code follows best practices
- Tests are adequate

**Use REQUEST_CHANGES when:**
- Security vulnerabilities present
- Critical bugs found
- Major design flaws
- Missing essential tests or error handling

**Use COMMENT when:**
- General feedback without blocking
- Questions for clarification
- Nice-to-have suggestions

## Important Reminders

- ❌ DO NOT include HTML comments in your output (like \`<!-- comment -->\`)
- ✅ DO quote actual code blocks in your inline comments
- ✅ DO provide specific, actionable suggestions
- ✅ DO explain the reasoning behind your feedback
- ✅ DO consider the PR author's perspective - be helpful, not harsh
- ⚠️ If the PR looks good, it's perfectly fine to APPROVE with an empty comments array and a positive message

## Expected Outcome

After you complete this task:
1. The review will be visible on the PR/MR
2. Inline comments will appear on specific lines of code
3. The overall assessment will be clear
4. The PR author will have actionable next steps

Now, proceed to review PR #${prDetails.number} and submit your review!
`

  let finalPrompt = basePrompt

  if (additionalContext) {
    finalPrompt += `\n\n## Additional Context from User\n\n${additionalContext}\n\nPlease incorporate this context into your review.`
  }

  return finalPrompt
}
