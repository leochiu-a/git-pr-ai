# Test-Driven Development Workflow

This skill ensures all code development follows TDD principles with comprehensive test coverage.

## When to Activate

- Writing new features or functionality
- Fixing bugs or issues
- Refactoring existing code
- Adding API endpoints
- Creating new components

## Core Principles

### 1. Tests BEFORE Code

ALWAYS write tests first, then implement code to make tests pass.

### 2. Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 80% coverage (unit + integration + E2E)
- All edge cases covered
- Error scenarios tested
- Boundary conditions verified

### 3. Test Types

#### Unit Tests

- Individual functions and utilities
- Component logic
- Pure functions
- Helpers and utilities

#### Integration Tests

- API endpoints
- Database operations
- Service interactions
- External API calls

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)

- Critical user flows
- Complete workflows
- Browser automation
- UI interactions

## TDD Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Write User Journeys

```
As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]

Example:
As a user, I want to search for markets semantically,
so that I can find relevant markets even without exact keywords.
```

### Step 2: Generate Test Cases

For each user journey, create comprehensive test cases:

```typescript
describe('Semantic Search', () => {
  it('returns relevant markets for query', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  })

  it('handles empty query gracefully', async () => {
    // Test edge case
  })

  it('falls back to substring search when Redis unavailable', async () => {
    // Test fallback behavior
  })

  it('sorts results by similarity score', async () => {
    // Test sorting logic
  })
})
```

### Step 3: Run Tests (They Should Fail)

```bash
pnpm test
# Tests should fail - we haven't implemented yet
```

### Step 4: Implement Code

Write minimal code to make tests pass:

```typescript
// Implementation guided by tests
export async function searchMarkets(query: string) {
  // Implementation here
}
```

### Step 5: Run Tests Again

```bash
pnpm test
# Tests should now pass
```

### Step 6: Refactor

Improve code quality while keeping tests green:

- Remove duplication
- Improve naming
- Optimize performance
- Enhance readability

## Best Practices

1. **Write Tests First** - Always TDD
2. **One Assert Per Test** - Focus on single behavior
3. **Descriptive Test Names** - Explain what's tested
4. **Arrange-Act-Assert** - Clear test structure
5. **Mock External Dependencies** - Isolate unit tests
6. **Test Edge Cases** - Null, undefined, empty, large
7. **Test Error Paths** - Not just happy paths
8. **Keep Tests Fast** - Unit tests < 50ms each
9. **Clean Up After Tests** - No side effects
10. **Review Coverage Reports** - Identify gaps

## Success Metrics

- All tests passing (green)
- No skipped or disabled tests
- Fast test execution (< 30s for unit tests)
- Tests catch bugs before production

**Remember**: Tests are not optional. They are the safety net that enables confident refactoring, rapid development, and production reliability.
